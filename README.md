# arduino
A dumping ground for my arduino playthings.

I'm probably doing this all wrong in GitHub, but I'm mostly just looking for a place to dump code snippets so I can keep track of them, and refer to them in blog posts without a ton of hand-editing the code, or tweaking the blog software to display code without mangling it.
